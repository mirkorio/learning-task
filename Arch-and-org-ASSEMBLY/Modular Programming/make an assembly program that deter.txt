make an assembly program that determine the LCD or GCF of two-digit numbers, an error message should be displayed if necessary, it should have input validation and the program loops until the user chooses 0 to Exit. Implement pass by reference using nasm/windows and it should be compatible to 32-bit system

Here is a sample run:
