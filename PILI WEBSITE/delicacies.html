			<h1> Pili Nuts </h1>
			<p>Another Bicol’s pride is Pili, a fruit-bearing tree that can be found across tropical Asia and other Pacific islands. 
                         However, although it can be found in other islands, the ones grown in the Bicol are acknowledged as the best-tasting. 
                         Pili tree yields a kernel called PILI NUT. </p>
			<p2>A Pili nut tastes like pumpkin seed when raw, and takes an entirely different identity when roasted. It is soft yet crisp,
                         with an easy crunch that melts in your mouth, making it a favorite snack of Bicolanos. A Pili nut has lots of flavors,
                         with caramelized as the common one. Caramelized Pili nuts can be found in any pasalubong center like CARAMEL PILI at Brgy. Cadlan, Pili,
                         near the maaliwalas community of Lessandra Pili, bus terminals, and markets around Naga City. </p2>

			<br><h1> Laing Pizza </h1>
			<p> Pizza is not only famous in Italy, but also in the Philippines. Bicol has its own version of pizza, the LAING PIZZA,
                        which can be found in the restaurant of Camarines Sur Watersports Complex located also at Brgy. Cadlan, Pili.
                        If you plan to introduce Bicolano cuisine to a visitor, this Bicolano Pizza is the perfect dish that depicts all Bicolano cuisine.
                        It has a rich coconut milk as its base, a plenty amount of cheese, Bicol express (pork in coconut milk with shrimp paste and chilis),
                        and Laing (dried taro leaves in coconut milk) perfectly garnished on top of a thin and crisp dough.</p>
