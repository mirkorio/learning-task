			<h1> THE FUTURE CITY OF CHOSEN : PILI </h1>
<br>
			<p> A Town of old in the Pearl Orient of the Seas— Pili: The Future City of Chosen is home to one of the most beautiful places in the country yet to be visited,
                            to captivating sights for eyes to feast upon, and to a distinct and rich culture yet to be experienced by one in their lifetime. Weeb Developers,
                            as proud residents of this lovely town, offer to pay tribute to it by promoting tourism to people all over the country and the world as well, 
                            not by using the inefficient method of person-to-person interaction that is not only plausible but dangerous as well during this pandemic,
                            but through safe and efficient means online. Thus, Pili: The Future City of Chosen needs an appropriate avenue to showcase the graceful 
                            town to promote tourism and advertise the town through online to cater to netizens and users without physical interactivity.</p>
